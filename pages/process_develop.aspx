    <h1>DEVELOP</h1>
      <p><strong>System Development</strong></p>
      <p>Strategy, creative design and programming comes together when we integrate   the user interface layer of the system, the front end, with the backend   infrastructure, the database, external systems and the heart of the system. </p>
      <p><strong>Hosting Environment</strong></p>
      <p>At this point we develop the hosting environment locally within our own   production facility, which will later be ported to the hosting provider of   choice mirroring the production environment to ensure a smooth transition. </p>
