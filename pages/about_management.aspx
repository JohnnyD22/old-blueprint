      <p><strong>John Davidson</strong>  - Design Lead, Project Lead, Technical Lead, UX Lead, Engagement Lead, Consultant</p>
      <p> I have over 21 years of    experience solutioning and implementing  sophisticated applications for such companies as Johnson &amp; Johnson, McNeil Nutritionals, McNeil Consumer &amp;   Specialty Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington Trust, FedEx, American Lung Association,   RPR, AgWeb, US Interactive, Anexinet, Brookwood and many more over the years.</p>
      <p>I use this site as a sample showcase of how software development projects work using the various methodologies. There are also pros and cons to using different methodologies and I can help your organization determine what the best approach would be and create a detailed execution document to support any given business requirements, while providing multiple options for the business stakeholders to review.</p>
      <p>I typically work with various stakeholders throughout an organization to understand their needs and work collaboratively with all business partners to create design interaction documents which completely detail all known functionality before any development begins. This helps all parties understand what the end vision looks like before any code is written. Capturing the business requirements clearly and translating those business requirements into annotated wireframes to further clarify and capture every pages functionality for use within test scripts during the QA phase is key to the successful execution of any development initiative. If you can't measure it, you can't manage it!</p>
