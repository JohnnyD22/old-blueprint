    <h1>DESIGN</h1>
    
      <p><strong>Design Prototyping</strong></p>
      <p>With input from our clients we develop the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the application based on the strategic goals. We provide several compelling interface designs and refine them until one best communicates the client's   message. </p>
      <p><strong>Application Design</strong></p>
      <p>Building from the requirements gathered earlier, we define a complete description of the system we are going to build. This includes conception and   design of the technical specifications, as well as implementation of the   functional solution.</p>
      <p><strong>Navigation Model</strong></p>
      <p>Data relationships are identified and data usage is analyzed to produce normalized and optimized data stores and structures. </p>
