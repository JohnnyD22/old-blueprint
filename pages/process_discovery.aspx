  <h1>DISCOVERY</h1>
  <p><strong>Strategic Planning</strong></p>
  <p>We provide research, analysis and planning, to help our clients identify and determine the projects direction. Deliverables can include usability, user testing, site architecture and a Blueprint of the work to be performed. </p>
  <p><strong>Requirements Gathering </strong></p>
  <p> Working in partnership with our clients, we investigate core business needs and determine what is necessary to achieve the desired goals. Deliverables include a functional specifications document and if necessary an updated project   schedule. </p>
  <p><strong>Prototyping/Wire frames</strong></p>
  <p>We collaborate with our clients to develop the sites blueprint/architecture that accomplishes the strategic goals and communicates those goals effectively. Deliverables include a click through shell and demonstrates the navigation and   flow of the solution. This is not a creative prototype but a functional   prototype allowing our customers to ensure the functionality is correct before   actual programming begins.</p>
  <p><strong>Context Diagram</strong></p>
  <p>This simple yet effective diagram attempts to define and illustrate the external systems or processes, which interact with the target system. </p>
  <p><strong>Risk Analysis</strong></p>
  <p>This is where a critical review of the system requirements are captured. Here potential risks are identified and suggestions to mitigate them, should   they arise. </p>
