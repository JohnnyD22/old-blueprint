      <p>Strategy and Architecture</p>
<p>Every engagement starts with strategic planning to ensure all goals are met   with company stakeholders. I begin with a series of strategy sessions with your   team and, preferably all the stakeholders for the project. Typically, these are   open discussions that allow for the widest possible range of ideas to be   exchanged from all participants. From these sessions, I produce a document   outlining the items discussed, any conclusions or requirements that were drawn,   and a solid blueprint for the remaining work.</p>
