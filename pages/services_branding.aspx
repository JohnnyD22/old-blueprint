<h1>BRANDING</h1>

  <p>When was the last time someone gave you a fantastic business card?   Did you turn it over and look at it closely? Did you comment on it? And   did you generate some sort of impression of that person and company?</p>
  <p><strong>Corporate identity is an extension of your brand and includes everything with your logo or contact information:</strong></p>
 	<ul>
      <li>Business cards</li>
 	  <li>Envelopes</li>
 	  <li>Letterhead</li>
 	  <li>Mailing labels</li>
 	  <li>Email templates &amp; signatures</li>
 	  <li>Fax covers</li>
 	  <li>Proposal/quote templates</li>
 	  <li>Invoices/statements</li>
 	  <li>Memos</li>
 	  <li>Signage</li>
 	  <li>Promotional items</li>
</ul>
 	<p>Many companies spend time and money on things like business cards yet   overlook proposal templates, invoices and email signatures that   prospects see more frequently. For example, when an employee customizes   an email template with unusual designs or fonts, it can contradict an   expensive and serious business card &ndash; and convey a far different   impression to the customer.</p>
 	<p>Each element in your identity should use the same fonts, colors,   layout, etc. The design itself may not be incredibly important unless   you&rsquo;re in a creative field, but consistency and professionalism make an   impression. In many cases it may be a first impression, so why not make a   good one?</p>
