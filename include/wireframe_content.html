			<strong>PRIMARY  NAVIGATION</strong><br />
				There‘s an art to effectively guiding your 
				readers around your site, so that they know 
				how much content is available, and where 
				to find things when they want them. 
				The easiest way to make a site easy to 
				navigate is simply to not surprise the 
				reader: put things where you would expect 
				them to be positioned.
